A fun little project that I am working on in CS225 Honor Section

The story so far…

1. Background

It has been 1000 moons since the land of Durham has been shrouded under the wings of Bálormr Flame-Shroud The Repugnant! But the mighty dragon stalks our land again. He breathes vile, sulfurous fumes, poisoning all! His scales glow as hot as flames, and he brings death without mercy. Even the King was not safe from the dragon's wrath. Bálormr has sacked the King's keep in Deira and captured the King's young daughter. Now the kingdom teeters on the edge of death, and the people of Durham wastes away as the dragon ravages the land.

Yet all hope is not lost, and a lone rider has appeared, carrying the sign of the dragon. The rider has arrived at the entrance of the King's castle in Deira, which now lays deserted. The rider slowly dismounts and enters the castle from the drawbridge. You are the rider. It is up to you to save the land of Durham and restore peace and harmony once again!

2. Entrance

In front of you stands the castle of Durham. Its walls are charred with the dragon’s flame breath, and you can still see the distinct claw marks of the beast had left behind. Somehow you feel like from this point on there is no return. It is your duty to save the kingdom! Venture forward brave adventurer.

3. Courtyard

You’ve crossed drawbridge into the courtyard. The once lush grass is not blackened into soot, and down the path stands the massive door to the ransacked castle.

4. Foyer

I moved past the courtyard, and finally came into the foyer. I can see the damage the dragon did as he forced his way into the castle. He seemed to have left behind a few of his scales by accident, and I pick one up and notice that its harder than any armor I have ever seen. It is clear that the mighty beast’s size was too great for this dwelling of man. Bálormr must be at least twenty feet tall! I will need to find a suitable weapon to defeat the beast.
