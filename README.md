A fun little project that I am working on in CS225 Honor Section

The story so far...

  It has been 1000 moons since the land of Durham has been shrouded under the wings of Bálormr Flame-Shroud The Repugnant! But the mighty dragon stalks our land again. He breathes vile, sulphurous fumes, poisoning all! His scales glow as hot as flames, and he brings death without mercy. Even the King was not safe from the dragon's wrath. Bálormr has sacked the King's keep in Deira and captured the King's young daughter. Now the kingdom teeters on the edge of death, and the people of Durham wastes away as the dragon ravages the land. 
  
  Yet all hope is not lost, and a lone rider has appeared, carrying the sign of the dragon. THe rider has arrived at the entrance of the King's castle in Deira, which now lays deserted. The rider slowly demounts and enters the castle from the drawbridge.
